# LinkedList Calculator

This program reads a file <input.txt> with two positive integers in each line and calculates the difference between two integers 
using a linked list and outputs the value in <output.txt> file. 

What makes this program special is that the there is no constraint or range for the value that each integers in the input file can hold. This means that each integers in the input file can exceed the value that normal int or long variables can store. 
This program computes the difference between two "BIG" integers, by constructing two linked lists where each node in the list stores each digit in each integers.
